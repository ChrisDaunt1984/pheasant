# Standalone Script

# Using Atom [Hydorgen](https://nteract.gitbooks.io/hydrogen/), you can execute
# any part of Python script code in Atom editor. So you can edit your Markdown
# verifing its execution and outputs. But unfortunately, the entire Markdown
# source cannot be executed all at once as a standalone program or cannot be
# ran by Python interpreter. Pheasant connects between a pure python script and
# structured Markdown representation for MkDocs.
