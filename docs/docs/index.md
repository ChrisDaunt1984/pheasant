# Pheasant

## Overview

Pheasant is a Markdown converter which is designed to work with [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) as a plugin.

Highlights include:

+ Auto generation of outputs for a fenced code block or inline code in Markdown source using [Jupyter client](https://jupyter-client.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). The code language is not restricted to Python.
+ Auto numbering of headers, figures, and tables, and etc. Numbered objects can be linked from other Markdown sources.

## How to install

You can install Pheasant from PyPI.

~~~bash
$ pip install pheasant
~~~

If you use Pheasant as a plugin of MkDocs, you also need to install it.

~~~bash
$ pip install mkdocs
~~~

## Settings for a MkDocs plugin

In your `mkdocs.yml`, add lines below:

~~~yaml
theme:
  name: rtd-pheasant

plugins:
  - pheasant
~~~

## Examples

### Auto generation of the executed outputs with Jupyter client

A markdown source below:

~~~
```python
print(1)
```
~~~

is converted into:

~~~
```python
print(1)
```

```python
1
```
~~~

after execution of `print` function via Jupyter client and finally rendered as:

```python
print(1)
```

### Inline code embeded in a Markdown source

"Inline code" is a powerful feature of Pheasant. Any python codes surrounded by `{{#` and `}}` are executed and the result remains there. For example, `{{#3*5}}` becomes {{3*5}}. Variables can be assigned in an inline code: `{{#name='pheasant'}}`{{name='pheasant'}}. Then, `"I'm {{#name}}."` becomes "I'm {{name}}." Note that an inline code without outputs is not shown after execution.

### Visualization

Pheasant supports various output formats other than standard stream. For example, you can create a PNG image using Matplotlib.

~~~
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

```python
plt.plot([1, 3, 2])
```
~~~

The above Markdown source creates an input Python code block and a PNG image:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

```python
plt.plot([1, 2, 4])
```

!!! Note
    I'm not sure but `import` statement and `plot` function must be runned in a different cell to generate a PNG image for the first running time.

You may want to display only graphics. You can set `display` option to a fenced code after language notation.

~~~
```python display
plt.plot([1, 2])
```
~~~

!!! Note
    Matplotlib package has already been imported in the previous code block so that we don't need to import it again here.


Pheasant also supports Bokeh's HTML output.


```python
from bokeh.plotting import figure

plot = figure(plot_width=250, plot_height=250)
plot.circle([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], size=10)
```

The last line of the above code block returns `GlyphRenderer` object. To show the bokeh's figure, we can use inline code described above:

~~~
{{plot}}
~~~

{{plot}}

In order to put the figure at the center, we can use inline code as "display" mode by adding a `!` marker.

~~~
{{!plot}}
~~~

{{!plot}}


Furthermore, Pheasant supports HoloViews including interactive HoloMap.


```python
import holoviews as hv
curve = hv.Curve(((1, 2), (2, 3)))
```

~~~
{{!curve}}
~~~

{{!curve}}

HoloMap can work as in a Jupyter Notebook.

```python
import numpy as np


def sine_curve(phase, freq):
    xvals = [0.1* i for i in range(100)]
    return hv.Curve((xvals, [np.sin(phase+freq*x) for x in xvals]))

frequencies = [0.5, 0.75, 1.0]
curve_dict = {f: sine_curve(0, f) for f in frequencies}
holomap = hv.HoloMap(curve_dict, kdims='Frequency')
```

~~~
{{!holomap}}
~~~

{{!holomap}}


### Auto numbering of headers, figures, tables, *etc*.

As you can see, all of headers are numbered in this document. This numbering has done by Pheasant automatically. In addition, Pheasant can count the number of figures, tables, *etc*. and give the identical number to each object.

You can use a special **"header"** statement for figure (`#Figure`) and table (`#Table`) to number them like below:

~~~
#Figure This is a cat. {#cat#}

![jpg](img/cat.jpg)
~~~

#Fig This is a cat. {#cat#}

![jpg](img/cat.jpg)

!!! Note
    In the above Markdown source, `{#<tag>#}` is an ID tag for hyperlink described below.

Off course, you can use any code to create a figure:

~~~
#Fig A Matplotlib figure

```python display
plt.plot([3, 2])
```
~~~

#Fig A Matplotlib figure

```python display
plt.plot([3, 1])
```

Like figures, tables can be numbered.

~~~
#Table A Markdown table

a | b
--|--
0 | 1
2 | 3
~~~

#Table A Markdown table

a | b
--|--
0 | 1
2 | 3

Pandas DataFarme is useful to create a table programmatically.

~~~
#Table A Pandas DataFrame

```python display
import pandas as pd
pd.DataFrame([[1, 2], [3, 4]], columns=list('ab')) * 2
```
~~~

#Table A Pandas DataFrame

```python display
import pandas as pd
pd.DataFrame([[1, 2], [3, 4]], columns=list('ab')) * 2
```

A Markdown source for figures and tables is a source block separated by a blank line from following Markdown source. If a figure or table has blank lines within it, you have to explicitly write the content range with `<!-- begin -->` and `<!-- end -->` statements.


~~~
#Fig A Bokeh's HTML figure
&lt;!-- begin --&gt;
{{!plot}}
&lt;!-- end --&gt;
~~~


#Fig A Bokeh's HTML figure
<!-- begin -->
{{!plot}}
<!-- end -->

However, Pheasant provides an easy way to number figures, tables, *etc*. regardless of whether they actually have any blank lines or not. Try this:

~~~
#Figure {{curve}} Inline numbering method.
~~~

#Fig Inline numbering method {{curve}}

!!! Note
    You can use an abbreviation for iditifiers after '#'. Tab for Table and Fig for Figure.


### Hyperlink

Numbered objects are linked from Markdown source using `{#<tag>#}`:

~~~markdown
For example, go to Fig. {#cat#}
~~~

For example, go to Fig. {#cat#}
