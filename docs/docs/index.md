# Pheasant

Welcome to Pheasant! In this section, overview and some interesting features of Pheasant are presented.

## Overview

Pheasant is a Markdown converter which is designed to work with [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) as a plugin.

Highlights include:

+ Auto generation of outputs for a fenced code block or inline code in Markdown source using [Jupyter client](https://jupyter-client.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). The code language is not restricted to Python.
+ Auto numbering of headers, figures, and tables, and etc. Numbered objects can be linked from other Markdown sources.

## Installation

You can install Pheasant from PyPI.

~~~bash
$ pip install pheasant
~~~

If you use Pheasant as a plugin of MkDocs, you also need to install it.

~~~bash
$ pip install mkdocs
~~~

Then, in your `mkdocs.yml`, add lines below to register Pheasant as a MkDocs plugin.

~~~yaml
plugins:
  - pheasant
~~~

## Getting Started

### Auto generation of the executed outputs with Jupyter client

A markdown source below:

~~~
```python
print(1)
```
~~~


is converted into:

~~~
```python
print(1)
```

```python
1
```
~~~


after execution of `print` function via [Jupyter client](https://jupyter-client.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and finally rendered as:

```python
print(1)
```


### Inline code embeded in a Markdown source

**"Inline code"** is a powerful feature of Pheasant. Any python codes surrounded by `{{#` and `}}` are executed and the result remains there. For example, `{{#3*5}}` becomes {{3*5}}. Variables can be assigned in an inline code like this: `{{#name='Pheasant'}}`{{name='Pheasant'}}. Then, `"I'm {{#name}}."` becomes "I'm {{name}}." Note that an inline code without outputs does not shown after execution.

### Visualization

Pheasant supports various output formats other than standard stream or plain text output. For example, you can create a PNG image using Matplotlib. First, import Matplotlib plotting library.

~~~copy
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```
~~~

Then, plot a line.

~~~copy
```python
plt.plot([1, 2])
```
~~~

Executin of the above Markdown source on a Jupyter kernel creates a plain text output as a execute result and a PNG image as display data. You may want to display only the image. You can set `display` option to a fenced code after language description:

~~~copy
```python display
plt.plot([1, 2])
```
~~~

Note that Matplotlib package has already been imported in the previous code block so that we don't need to import it again here.

Pheasant also supports Bokeh's HTML output. First, create a figure object.

```python
from bokeh.plotting import figure

plot = figure(plot_width=250, plot_height=250)
```

Now, you can use `plot.circle` function to add some scatter points.

~~~copy
```python
plot.circle([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], size=10)
plot
```
~~~

{{plot}}

The last line of the above code block returns a `Figure` object. To show the corresponding figure instead of it, we can use the `display` option described above:

~~~copy
```python display
plot
```
~~~

As well as a fenced code with `display` option, we can choose inline code style: `{{#plot}}`

{{plot}}


Furthermore, Pheasant supports HoloViews objects as well as interactive HoloMap.

~~~copy
```python display
import holoviews as hv
curve = hv.Curve(((1, 2), (2, 3)))
```
~~~

Then `{{#curve}}` generates a HoloView ojbect: {{curve}}

HoloMap can work as in a Jupyter Notebook.


```python
import numpy as np


def sine_curve(phase, freq):
    xvals = [0.1* i for i in range(100)]
    return hv.Curve((xvals, [np.sin(phase+freq*x) for x in xvals]))

frequencies = [0.5, 0.75, 1.0]
curve_dict = {f: sine_curve(0, f) for f in frequencies}
holomap = hv.HoloMap(curve_dict, kdims='Frequency')
```

~~~copy
{{holomap}}
~~~

### Auto numbering of headers, figures, tables, *etc*.

As you can see, all of headers are numbered in this document. This numbering has done by Pheasant automatically. In addition, Pheasant can count the number of figures, tables, *etc*. and give the identical number to each object.

You can use a special **"header"** statement for figure, table, *etc*. to number them like below:

~~~
#Fig Markdown link for an image can be numbered. {##cat#}
![jpg](img/cat.jpg)
~~~

#Fig Markdown link for an image can be numbered. {#cat#}
![jpg](img/cat.jpg)

Supported numbered headers are shown in the next table:

#Tab Supported numbered headers
Type   | Markdown
-------|-------------------------------
Header | # (title)
Figure | #Figure (title), #Fig (title)
Table  | #Table (title), #Tab (title)
Code   | #Code (title)
File   | #File (title)

In the above Markdown source, `{##<tag>#}` is an ID tag for hyperlink described below. Off course, you can use any code to create a figure:


~~~copy
#Fig A Matplotlib figure
```python display
plt.plot([3, 2])
```
~~~

Like figures, tables can be numbered.

~~~copy
#Table A Markdown table
a | b
--|--
0 | 1
2 | 3
~~~

Pandas's DataFarme is useful to create a table programmatically.

~~~copy
#Table A Pandas's DataFrame
```python display
import pandas as pd

pd.DataFrame([[1, 2], [3, 4]], index=list('XY'), columns=list('ab'))
```
~~~

A **plain** Markdown source which is not processed by Pheasant has to be separated by a blank line from the following Markdown source which is not a part of the figure or table. If a figure or table has blank lines within it, you have to write the content in a fenced code with tilde (`~~~`).

~~~~copy
#Fig A figure with a blank line
~~~
![jpg](img/cat.jpg)

![jpg](img/cat.jpg)
~~~
~~~~

In addition, Pheasant provides an easy way to number figures, tables, *etc*. regardless of whether they actually have any blank lines or not. Try this:

~~~copy
#Figure {{curve}} Inline numbering method.
~~~

### Hyperlink

Numbered objects are linked from Markdown source using `{##<tag>#}`:

~~~markdown
For example, go to Fig. {##cat#}
~~~

For example, go to Fig. {#cat#}
